**XSS Pro** is a powerful, multi-threaded Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability scanner that automatically discovers and tests web application endpoints for XSS vulnerabilities. It leverages historical web data from archive.org to find potential attack vectors.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated URL Discovery**: Fetches URLs from Wayback Machine archives
- **Multi-threaded Scanning**: Configurable thread count for faster scanning
- **Smart URL Filtering**: Automatically filters out static files and non-parameterized URLs
- **Proxy Support**: Route requests through proxy servers
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Monitor scanning progress with ETA calculations
- **Colorized Output**: Easy-to-read results with color-coded status messages
- **Batch Processing**: Scan multiple domains from a file
- **Configurable Payloads**: Custom XSS payload injection
- **Results Export**: Save vulnerable URLs to organized output files

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Internet connection for archive.org access
- Valid target domains with proper authorization

## üõ† Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SIAM-T/xss-finder.git
cd xss-finder
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the tool:**
```bash
python xsspro.py -h
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

**Scan a single domain:**
```bash
python xsspro.py -d example.com
```

**Scan multiple domains from a file:**
```bash
python xsspro.py -l domains.txt
```

### Advanced Usage

**Custom thread count and verbose output:**
```bash
python xsspro.py -d example.com -t 20 -v
```

**Using proxy and custom payload:**
```bash
python xsspro.py -d example.com --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 -p "alert(1)"
```

**Stream URLs without scanning:**
```bash
python xsspro.py -d example.com -s
```

**Custom output directory:**
```bash
python xsspro.py -d example.com -o results
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-d, --domain` | Target domain name | None |
| `-l, --list` | File containing list of domains | None |
| `-s, --stream` | Stream URLs to terminal without scanning | False |
| `--proxy` | Proxy server address (http://ip:port) | None |
| `-p, --placeholder` | XSS payload placeholder | `xss<>` |
| `-o, --output` | Output directory for results | `xss` |
| `-t, --threads` | Number of scanning threads | 10 |
| `-v, --verbose` | Verbose output (show all results) | False |

## üìÅ Output Structure

```
xss/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example.com.txt          # Vulnerable URLs for example.com
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ target.org.txt           # Vulnerable URLs for target.org
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Each output file contains the vulnerable URLs found during the scan, one per line.

## üîç How It Works

1. **URL Discovery**: Queries Wayback Machine for historical URLs of the target domain
2. **URL Filtering**: Removes static files and URLs without parameters
3. **Payload Injection**: Replaces parameter values with XSS test payloads
4. **Vulnerability Testing**: Sends HTTP requests and analyzes responses
5. **Result Analysis**: Identifies reflected XSS vulnerabilities
6. **Report Generation**: Saves vulnerable URLs to organized output files

## üéØ Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Scan a single domain with verbose output
python xsspro.py -d vulnerable-site.com -v

# 2. Create a domains file
echo "site1.com" > targets.txt
echo "site2.com" >> targets.txt

# 3. Batch scan with custom settings
python xsspro.py -l targets.txt -t 15 -o scan_results

# 4. Review results
cat scan_results/site1.com.txt
```

## üö® Important Notes

### Legal and Ethical Usage
- **Only test domains you own or have explicit permission to test**
- This tool is intended for security professionals and ethical hackers
- Unauthorized testing may violate laws and regulations
- Always follow responsible disclosure practices

### Rate Limiting
- The tool implements automatic rate limiting to avoid overwhelming target servers
- Uses random user agents and exponential backoff for failed requests
- Respects server response times with built-in delays

### Accuracy
- Results may include false positives - manual verification is recommended
- The tool tests for reflected XSS only
- Complex XSS scenarios may require manual testing

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **Use responsibly**: Only scan domains you own or have permission to test
- **Network monitoring**: Scanning activities may be logged by target systems
- **Proxy usage**: Consider using proxy servers for additional privacy
- **Legal compliance**: Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations

## üîß Customization

### Custom Payloads
Modify the default payload by using the `-p` option:
```bash
python xsspro.py -d example.com -p '<script>alert("XSS")</script>'
```

### File Extensions
The tool automatically filters out common static file extensions. To modify the list, edit the `HARDCODED_EXTENSIONS` constant in the source code.

### User Agents
Random user agents are used to avoid detection. Additional user agents can be added to the `USER_AGENTS` list in the source code.

## üìä Performance Tips

1. **Optimize thread count**: Start with 10 threads and adjust based on your system and network
2. **Use proxy for large scans**: Distribute load across multiple proxy servers
3. **Monitor progress**: Press spacebar during scanning to see real-time progress
4. **Batch processing**: Process multiple domains efficiently using the list option

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No URLs with parameters to scan"**
- The target domain may not have archived URLs with query parameters
- Try checking if the domain exists in Wayback Machine manually

**Connection timeouts**
- Reduce thread count (`-t` option)
- Check internet connection and proxy settings
- Verify target domain accessibility

**Permission errors**
- Ensure write permissions in the output directory
- Run with appropriate user privileges

### Debug Mode
Use verbose mode (`-v`) to see detailed scanning progress and identify issues.

## üìà Performance Metrics

- **Scanning Speed**: ~100-500 URLs per minute (depending on target response times)
- **Memory Usage**: ~50-200MB (scales with thread count)
- **Network Bandwidth**: ~1-10 Mbps (varies with payload size and frequency)
